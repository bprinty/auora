# Guide

## Overview

This is placeholder documentation for a generic javascript package. For a new project, this section should be changed.


## Prerequisites

Talk about prerequisites for understanding the project. If there are ideas or concepts the user should reference if they're confused, those should go here with [links](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECMAScript).


## Quickstart

### Idea

Cover the nuances of the main concepts in these idea blocks, with code:

```javascript
const a = 1;
```

### Diagrams

Diagrams are helpful for explaining abstract concepts.

</mermaid>

### A Minimal Application
